# Project/ Flood Chat
Flood Chat

## Project description
In response to the increasing frequency of flood events in Africa, our team has developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) chatbot and a Machine Learning (ML) project to enhance awareness and provide guidelines on staying safe during flood occurrences. This project integrates a chatbot capable of answering user queries related to flood events in Africa and an ML model trained on historical flood data for the continent.

The Flood Chat Chatbot is designed to engage users in natural language conversations, providing real-time information and guidelines on staying safe during flood events. Users can ask questions related to flood preparedness, response strategies, and specific details about past flood events in Africa. The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand and respond to user queries, ensuring a user-friendly and informative experience.

The Flood_chat Chatbot, coupled with the ML project, offers a comprehensive solution to flood awareness and safety. Users can interact with the chatbot to receive personalized guidelines, while the ML model provides valuable insights into historical flood patterns in Africa, aiding in proactive preparedness and response strategies.

By combining cutting-edge NLP and ML technologies, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts to mitigate the impact of natural disasters, fostering a safer and more resilient environment in flood-prone regions of Africa.
